              <div id="summary-div">
                <p class="text">Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist renowned as the inventor of the World Wide Web. Born in London in 1955, Berners-Lee developed the foundational concepts and protocols for the web while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

                  In 1989, he proposed the idea of a hypertext system to facilitate information sharing among researchers. This led to the creation of the first web browser, editor, and server software, as well as the implementation of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) standards. 
                  
                  In 1991, Berners-Lee launched the first website, which outlined the basic principles of the World Wide Web and provided information on how to create web pages.
                  
                  His visionary work democratized access to information, revolutionizing communication, collaboration, and commerce on a global scale. Berners-Lee's commitment to an open and decentralized web has shaped the digital landscape and earned him numerous accolades, including a knighthood, the Turing Award, and the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. His ongoing efforts through organizations like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) continue to advance the web's development and ensure its accessibility to all.</p>
